        "Knowledge bases in enterprises are very common in the industry today and can have extensive number of documents in different categories. Retrieving relevant content based on a user query is a challenging task.  Given a query we were able to retrieve information accurately at the document level using methods such as Page Rank developed and made highly accurate especially by Google,  after this point the user has to delve into the document and search for the relevant information.  With recent advances in Foundation Models such as the one developed by Open AI the challenge is alleviated by using “Semantic Search” methods by using encoding information such as “Embeddings” to find the relevant information and then to summarize the content to present to the user in a concise and succinct manner.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will introduce the Use Case and will walk you through leveraging Azure Cognitive Search to extract relevant documents and leveraging the power of GPT-3 to address relevant part of the document, and provide a summary based on the prompt (instruction given to the model). It aims to demonstrate how to use Azure OpenAI’s GPT-3 capabilities to adapt to your summarization case, and how to set up and evaluate summarization results. The method is customizable to your summarization use case and can be applied to many different datasets. "

        "- Document Zone search\n",
        "- Text summarization\n",

        "Document Search is the process of extracting relevant document based on the query from a corpus of documents.\n",

        "This use case can be useful in helping subject matter experts in finding relevant information from large document corpus.\n",
        "Example: In the drug discovery process, scientists in pharmaceutical industry read a corpus of documents to find specific information related to concepts, experiment results etc. This use case enables them to ask questions from the document corpus and the solution will come back with the succinct answer. Consequently, expediting the drug discovery process.\n",

        "Benefits of the solution:\n",
        "1. Shortens reading time\n",
        "2. Improves the effectiveness of searching for information\n",
        "3. Removes bias from human summarization techniques\n",
        "4. Increases bandwidth for humans to focus on more in-depth analysis \n",

        "The need for document summarization be applied to any subject matter (legal, financial, journalist, medical, academic, etc) that requires long document summarization. The subject matter that this notebook is focusing on is journalistic - we will walk through news articles. If the topic gets more domain specific, fine-tuning of the GPT3-model would work better rather than just using the few-shot or zero-shot example methods.  \n"

        "An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different Azure OpenAI embedding models are specifically created to be good at a particular task. Similarity embeddings are good at capturing semantic similarity between two or more pieces of text. Text search embeddings help measure long documents are relevant to a short query. Code search embeddings are useful for embedding code snippets and embedding nature language search queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Embeddings make it easier to do machine learning on large inputs representing words by capturing the semantic similarities in a vector space. Therefore, we can use embeddings to if two text chunks are semantically related or similar, and inherently provide a score to assess similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Cosine Similarity\n",
        "A previously used approach to match similar documents was based on counting maximum number of common words between documents. This is flawed since as the document size increases, the overlap of common words increases even if the topics differ. Therefore cosine similarity is a better approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. This is beneficial because if two documents are far apart by Euclidean distance because of size, they could still have a smaller angle between them and therefore higher cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Azure OpenAI embeddings rely on cosine similarity to compute similarity between documents and a query."

Using this approach, the first part of the prompt includes natural language instructions and/or examples of the specific task desired. The model then completes the task by predicting the most probable next text. This technique is known as \"in-context\" learning. \n",
